# EMI - Port Forward

**PF-EMI** or **EMI - Port Forward** started as a _standalone port forward_ for 1.21.11 for my mod, ProjectFlint, and has now become a widely used port for 1.21.2+, featuring NeoForge, Forge, and Fabric versions. Port Forward exists to not only port forward the last features from the prev. version of EMI, but also so it can add new features for the newest versions, improving EMI overall. Below is EMI's direct description.

# Github Branches

While source code can be provided for older versions, the only versions receiving active updates will have specific Github Branches, however, in the future, I'd like to get all branches for all released versions put into github.

The main branch serves as the specific branch for just my standalone mod needs for ProjectFlint.

# EMI's Main Changes
EMI is a featureful and accessible item and recipe viewer for Minecraft.

## Developers
To add EMI to your project as a dependency you need to add the following to your `build.gradle`:
```gradle
repositories {
	maven {
		name = "TerraformersMC"
		url = "https://maven.terraformersmc.com/"
	}
}
```

How EMI gets added to your dependencies varies based on modloader and setup.
The Gradle property `emi_version` should be something like `1.0.0+1.19.4` with EMI's version and Minecraft's version.
Here are common dependency setups for different loaders and build systems.

```gradle
dependencies {
	// Fabric
	modCompileOnly "dev.emi:emi-fabric:${emi_version}:api"
	modLocalRuntime "dev.emi:emi-fabric:${emi_version}"

	// Forge (see below block as well if you use Forge Gradle)
	compileOnly fg.deobf("dev.emi:emi-forge:${emi_version}:api")
	runtimeOnly fg.deobf("dev.emi:emi-forge:${emi_version}") 

	// NeoForge
	compileOnly "dev.emi:emi-neoforge:${emi_version}:api"
	runtimeOnly "dev.emi:emi-neoforge:${emi_version}" 

	// Architectury
	modCompileOnly "dev.emi:emi-xplat-intermediary:${emi_version}:api"

	// MultiLoader Template/VanillaGradle
	compileOnly "dev.emi:emi-xplat-mojmap:${emi_version}:api"
}
```

For Forge Gradle users, you will need to enable Mixin refmaps in your client sourceset. This can be done by adding 2 lines inside of your client runs, to look like below.

```gradle
runs {
	client {
		// Add these two lines
		property 'mixin.env.remapRefMap', 'true'
		property 'mixin.env.refMapRemappingFile', "${projectDir}/build/createSrgToMcp/output.srg"

		// The rest of the code that was already here
		// ...
	}
}
```
